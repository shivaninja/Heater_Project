"READ ME"

	IMPORTANT:  
		NOTE: This Whole project folder consists of two Projects( PROJECT 1 & PROJECT 2).



	PROJECT 1:
		(No SPI Protocol): This one does not uses the SPI communication protocol. 
		It is implementation of " Header Control System " in Arduino. It uses built in ADC(Analog to digital converter) & its function to read data from sensor.


	PROJECT 2:
		(Uses SPI Protocol): This one uses the SPI communication protocol. 
		It is implementation of " Header Control System " in Arduino. It uses SPI protocol & its functions to read data from sensor.
  		So, make sure to include  """ #include <Wire.h> """ // Library for IÂ²C communication
